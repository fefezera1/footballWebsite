        On 3 August 2017, Barcelona announced that Neymar's legal representatives made a payment of €222 million to the club, equal to the release clause of his contract, which constituted the most expensive transfer ever.Neymar joined PSG on a contract that would run until 2022.He was offered the number 10 shirt by Javier Pastore as a "welcome gift".<br>It was believed that PSG signed Neymar to increase their chances of winning the Champions League.The relationship between Neymar and Barcelona fans was tainted following his unexpected transfer to PSG, with some fans burning Barcelona jerseys with Neymar's name on it.In his presentation on 17 August, Neymar said that leaving Barcelona was one of the toughest decisions in his life.</p>
    <h2>2017–18: Debut season and domestic treble</h2>
    <p>Neymar made his debut for Les Rouge-et-Bleu on 13 August 2017, scoring a goal and assisting another in a 3–0 away victory over Guingamp.Highlighting the hype around Neymar's arrival in Paris, the match was broadcast in 183 countries.After the match, Neymar said, "People think that leaving Barca is to die, but it's the opposite...I'm more alive than ever."<br>
        He added two more goals to his tally in the next Ligue 1 fixture against Toulouse.Forming a prolific attacking trio alongside teenage French prodigy Kylian Mbappé and Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani, Neymar scored one each in PSG's two opening games of the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League group stage, with the team winning 5–0 at Celtic and 3–0 at home over Bayern Munich respectively.Neymar finished in third place in the 2017 Ballon d'Or and in the same year was ranked the third-best footballer in the world by The Guardian, both times behind Messi and Ronaldo.</p>
        <h2>2019–20: PSG's first Champions League final</h2>
        <p>
            Neymar made his first appearance for PSG in the 2019–20 season on 14 September, in a 1–0 victory over Strasbourg in Ligue 1. He scored the winning goal in injury time in the second half from a bicycle kick.One week later, he again scored a late winner, as PSG defeated Lyon 1–0 at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais.Neymar suffered a hamstring injury in October while on international duty with Brazil and returned to play for PSG during their Champions League group match against Real Madrid on 26 November in a 2–2 draw.<br>Neymar won his third league title after PSG were awarded Ligue 1 as the season finished early due to the COVID-19 pandemic.In his first 50 matches in Ligue 1, Neymar scored 46 goals, being the first player to do so since Marseille's Gunnar Andersson in the early 1950s.On 24 July 2020, in PSG's first professional game back after the pandemic, Neymar scored his side's lone goal in a 1–0 win over Saint-Étienne in the Coupe de France Final, winning his second Coupe de France title with the club.</p>
        <h2>August 2023: Departure</h2>
        <p>Despite being PSG's fourth-highest scorer and winning ten trophies, including five Ligue 1 titles, Neymar's tenure at PSG was marred by injuries and unfulfilled expectations, most notably not helping PSG win a Champions League. He missed 119 matches for PSG in total as a result of being injured around 20 times across his six-year spell, showing a fragility that was not seen either at Barcelona or Santos.James Westwood of Goal wrote that Neymar wasted the best years of his career and that in 2017 he had "the world at his feet" playing for Barcelona, throwing away his chance to join Pelé and Messi as a "true legend of the game" by joining PSG.Regardless, Neymar has been credited as a legend of PSG, trailing only Ibrahimović, Cavani and Mbappé in the club's top scorers at the time of his departure.<br>At the end of the 2022–23 season, PSG began a squad overhaul and after not renewing the contracts of Sergio Ramos and Lionel Messi, following the arrival of Luis Enrique as the club's new manager, Neymar and Marco Verratti were informed that they would not be in the team's plans for the following season.Shortly after, Neymar was linked with a potential return to Barcelona. However, Barcelona's hierarchy never reached an advanced stage to discuss finer economic details and possibilities, as the club's manager Xavi was not keen on signing him, leading both clubs to fail to reach an agreement.Other top clubs also distanced themselves from signing Neymar</p>
