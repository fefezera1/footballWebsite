    <main><p>Hi there! My name is Fellipe Pesqueira I'm the creator and writer of this website.<br> I'm from Brazil and I'm 19 years old. I really love two things that make me feel happy and interested: soccer and playing video games. Brazil is a place where people really love soccer, so I also grew up loving it a lot. Whether I'm watching an exciting game or playing soccer myself, it's a big part of my life and I enjoy it a whole lot!</p>
   <p> Playing video games is a big part of who I am. It helps me relax and gives me a chance to have fun and test myself. I can explore new worlds and play against other people. Even though it's different from playing sports, both activities make me really happy. Whether I'm playing soccer or playing video games, I'm always ready for an exciting time.</p>

<p> A famouse quote that reflects alot in my life is a Bible verse is Psalm 23:1 <br><em>The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul:</em></p></main>
