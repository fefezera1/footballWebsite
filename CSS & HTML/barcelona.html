    <main><h2>Fisrt Appearance on the Team</h2>
    <p>On 24 May 2013, Santos announced that they had received two offers for Neymar. The following day, Neymar announced he would sign with Barcelona on 27 May and join the team after playing in the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. Neither Neymar nor the clubs released details on the transfer fee or personal terms, save to say he signed a five-year deal.On 3 June, Neymar was unveiled by Barcelona after passing medical tests and signing a contract that would keep him at the club through June 2018.</p>
    <p>Neymar was presented at the Camp Nou in front of 56,500 fans, a record turnout for a Brazilian player.Club vice-president Josep Maria Bartomeu initially said Neymar's transfer fee was €57.1 million and his release clause set at €190 million.Barcelona's doctor suggested he might need to gain weight to be able to cope physically in Spanish football.</p>
    <h2>Transfer Investigation</h2>
    <p>In January 2014, the prosecutor's office in Madrid began investigating the transfer fee that Barcelona paid for Neymar.The documents submitted to the authorities on request contained contradictory information.On 23 January 2014, Rosell resigned from his position as president.A day later, the details of the transfer were revealed by Barcelona; the transfer had in fact cost them €86.2 million (£71.5 million)with Neymar's parents confirmed to have received a €40 million sum.In the aftermath, Barcelona and Bartomeu were charged with tax fraud.</p>
